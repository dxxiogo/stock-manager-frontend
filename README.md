  # 📦 Full Stack Inventory Management System - Frontend

  A full stack web project developed to assist in inventory management, allowing users to efficiently add, remove, update, and view items. This frontend application interacts with the backend API available at [stock-manager-backend](https://github.com/dxxiogo/stock-manager-backend). Additionally, the project offers valuable insights, such as items added in the last 15 days, products with low quantity, and the diversity of items in stock.

  Built with React for the front-end and TypeScript, Node.js, Express, Prisma, and PostgreSQL for the back-end, this project provides an intuitive interface for effectively controlling inventory.
